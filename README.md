## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML structure

- Flexbox for layout
- Media queries for responsiveness

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-direction: column;
}
```

### Continued development

Explore using CSS grid for potentially more complex layouts in future projects.
